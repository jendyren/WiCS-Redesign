							<!-- faq question -->
							<h1 class="faq-page">What is a hackathon?</h1>
							<!-- faq answer -->
							<div class="faq-body">
								<p>
									A hackathon is a day-long event where attendees can: compete for prize categories, attend workshops, and participate in fun activities and games. Competing is completely optional! You can also choose which workshops/activities you want or don’t want to attend based on your interests.
								</p>

						<div class="faq-two">
							<!-- faq question -->
							<h1 class="faq-page">Do I need to know how to code?</h1>
							<!-- faq answer -->
							<div class="faq-body">
								<p>
									Short answer: Nope!

									Long answer: HopperHacks is a beginner-friendly hackathon, so please do not feel as if you need to have any coding experience to participate. If you do not know how to code but want to learn and have fun, we have workshops and activities throughout the event for you to attend.

									We know that hackathons can be intimidating for many first-time hackers, and so we want this to be a learning and fun experience for you to become more comfortable with working with others, developing new skills, and letting your creativity shine under a time constraint.

							<!-- faq question -->
							<h1 class="faq-page">How do I come up with an idea for a project?</h1>

								<p>
									Think about what changes you want to bring to the world. Think of any issues you and/or anyone else have faced in the past or are still facing that you want to focus on resolving. You can think of a target audience and a resolution.
